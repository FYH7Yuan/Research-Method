abstract = {With increases in aging and chronic disease, there have been efforts to apply IT to healthcare. Many studies show that the will to exercise (self-efficacy) is the most important factor contributing to physical activity. However, those who need exercise do not have this will so that an approach to increase the motivation for physical activity should be unconscious. Thus, playing Pokemon GO, an augmented reality (AR) mobile game requiring players to ambulate in reality, increases the physical activity of individuals with a simple motivation of enjoyment. A survey on 237 Pokemon GO players was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) considering libertarian paternalism. The results show that self-efficacy had a non-significant effect on attitude toward the game Pokemon GO, while previous studies found that self-efficacy is the most important factor in increasing physical activity. This indicates that playing AR drives physical activity, subconsciously and effectively.},

abstract = {•Analyzed the impact of GPS noise on User Experience in Location-based AR games.•Different games are impacted differently by noise.•Multimodal noise processes have a lower impact than equivalent unimodal processes.
Augmented Reality (AR) gaming is leaving the lab and entering the general population with a combination of high-end systems from the likes of Microsoft and Facebook as well as magic window AR games for commodity smartphones like Pokemon Go. Unlike traditional video games, AR games must solve the registration problem to map objects in the real world to the screen via the camera. Sensors are typically employed to provide the real world pose of the physical camera. However, like all sensors, the location and orientation sensors are subject to noise processes. While the interaction between noise processes and player enjoyment has been studied in networked games, limited work has been done examining the impact of sensor noise on player enjoyment in AR games and that work has been largely confined to simple noise models. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the impact on location based AR games of GPS noise on player experience. Our analysis shows that different games are impacted differently by noise. Multimodal noise processes can have a lower impact on player experience than equivalent unimodal processes, when players can time their interactions.},

However, how can this type of information can be integrated in new gaming contexts like virtual reality? Should this information be integrated into the game universe (diegetic design) or stay out of it (non-diegetic design)? For this purpose, the performance, presence, and enjoyment of 41 players have been measured during a virtual reality first-person shooter game session with a diegetic and a non-diegetic interface. The results showed that diegetic integration has a positive effect on the player's performance but not on the subjective experience (presence and enjoyment). The study also shed light on the moderator role of expertise in action games on this effect because the diegetic interface only benefited novice players.},

abstract = {In 2019, the Harry Potter-themed augmented reality (AR) game
Wizards Unite
was released, one which employed the same game mechanics as
Pokémon Go
. In order to explore the similarities and differences in players’ perceptions, motivations to play, and missing functions in
Wizards Unite
and
Pokémon Go
, we conducted a web-based survey which targeted active players of
Wizards Unite
14 weeks after its release. The results are compared to a survey applying the same methodology and questions directed at active players of
Pokémon Go
. An important reason why many players started playing
Wizards Unite
was that they were already Harry Potter fans. For
Wizards Unite
players the motivation stemming from public attention was lower compared to that for
Pokémon Go
players. The main motivating factors drawing players to these games include fun, curiosity, and being physically active. The AR function was not mentioned as a motivating factor for either game. The aspect of players being able to collect and complete the game was more of a motivation for playing
Pokémon Go
. Although the game mechanisms are similar, we identified specific differences in the motivational factors of the two games. The main difference is the misfit between the general game story with hunting and collecting within the Harry Potter universe. Nevertheless, the theme of the game and its background story can be important long-term motivating factors of
Wizards Unite
. The findings in this paper provide insights into how one can create AR games that meet players’ needs.},

Although location-based augmented reality (AR) games are popular in recent years, the motivates of the game’s stickiness still need further investigation. The main goal of this research is to investigate the antecedents of the game’s stickiness. This research develops a conceptual model and hypotheses based on the theory of flow and satisfaction to investigate the antecedents. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed on popular websites to collect data, and 1028 usable responses are collected from the players of Pokémon Go in Taiwan. The eleven hypotheses and control variables were validated by using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. Among the antecedents of the game’s stickiness in the model, the flow and satisfaction were found to have strong direct effects. The effects of control variables (age, gender, platform, game experience, and in-app expense) on the stickiness were significant as well. Moreover, telepresence, challenge, perceived control, curiosity, and concentration all have direct influences on the flow. Only perceived currency and responsiveness were found to have a direct impact on players’ satisfaction. The model demonstrated good explanatory power for flow and stickiness in the context of location-based AR game. The proposed model can provide insights to location-based AR game developers to design their games and marketing strategies.},

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) has become a promising technology in the gaming industry. However, few research studies have examined users' perspectives towards mobile AR games. To address this issue, the present study proposed a research model to better understand the factors determining and shaping users' behavioral intention to adopt mobile AR games from a developing country environment. Based on a literature review, nine factors have been expected to determine and shape individuals' intention towards the acceptance and adoption of mobile AR games. Using WarpPLS software, the model was empirically tested with a survey of 240 non-adopter respondents collected via an online survey questionnaire. The model was found statistically robust in terms of measurement quality criteria: reliability, validity, multicollinearity, and goodness of fit. The analysis revealed that perceived ease-of-use, social norms, privacy, perceived enjoyment, perceived competition, perceived inspiration, perceived image, and perceived innovativeness affect users' behavioral intention to adopt mobile AR games. However, the hypothesized moderating impact of perceived physical risk on the relationships connecting perceived ease-of-use, perceived enjoyment, perceived competition, and perceived inspiration with the intention to adopt was found to have little statistical significance. The result showed that perceived innovativeness was the strongest criterion to affect intention, and perceived ease-of-use was found to be the least important criterion in impacting users' intention. Interestingly, the model explains 76% of the variance in behavioral intention to adopt mobile AR games. This study offers theoretical and practical implications for its findings.

abstract = {A loyalty program is an important link between consumers and merchants in daily consumption. While new technologies (e.g. gamification, social networks, augmented reality, and so on) make it possible to strengthen this bond, their potential has not yet been fully exploited. In our research, we explore a novel approach to integrate gamification and social interaction into a loyalty program based on augmented reality (AR). We propose an AR-based gamified point system which supports users in obtaining pet-based dynamic feedback on mobile devices and provides a multi-user environment for social interaction. Compared to traditional point systems, pet-based designs help to establish an emotional connection between users and the system. The multi-user environment is designed to increase the user's motivation through the positive effects of social interactions. Our system provides interpersonal communication channels between users, including competitive and non-competitive interactions. We performed an evaluation consisting of two experiments to examine the effects of game elements (mission and feedback) and social cues (competitive and non-competitive interactions). In the first experiment, we analyze the change in online shopping behavior before and after adding game elements. The results show that gamification can increase user participation in online shopping. In the second experiment, we study the effects of social cues. The results show that social cues can motivate users to participate in the use of a gamified point system.},
